# AddressBookConsoleApp
[[[TTS final project for FT Foundational Java]]]

This is an address book console application that can do the following:

-Add an entry

-Remove an entry

-Search for a specific entry

-Print the contents of the address book 

-Delete the contents of the address book 

-Quit the program


I will update it soon so that it can also do the following:

-Make input parameter checks look for a valid phone number & email format

-Save address book to a file

-Load address book from a file

(***note***: this optional update is in leui of presenting on Monday, as I will be out of town for a very short 
break before joining Erik & Melissa in the Advance FT cohort that begins first thing Tuesday morning)
